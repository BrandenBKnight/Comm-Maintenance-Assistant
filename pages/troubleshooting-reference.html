					<h2>Dummy System One Remote Troubleshooting</h2>
					<p>
						Follow the steps below to perform remote troubleshooting on the
						Dummy system one:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Ask users to report any issues they are encountering.
							Additionally, instruct them to check their status screen and make
							a note of all reported faults for further analysis.
						</li>
						<li>
							After receiving the faults, refer to Table 4-5 in the technical
							guide for potential solutions.
						</li>
						<li>
							Check the system's time. The time can be found at the top left of
							the main screen. Ideally, the reported time should be synchronized
							with a reliable source.
						</li>
						<li>Instruct users to execute the alternative plan.</li>
						<li>
							If problems persist, guide the users to perform a soft reset. This
							can be done through the system's settings. Afterwards, they should
							attempt the primary plan. If this fails, suggest trying the
							alternative plan again.
						</li>
						<li>
							If the issue remains unresolved, direct the users to reload their
							generic setting 1, 2, 3, and 4, in this sequence.
						</li>
						<li>
							Advise the users to contact the Support Center to verify if their
							user ID is displaying as online.
						</li>
						<li>
							If the system still fails to log on, instruct the users to perform
							a Hard Reset and attempt logging in with primary settings. If this
							fails, suggest trying the alternative settings again.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Dummy System Two Remote Troubleshooting Guide</h2>
					<p>
						Follow the instructions below to remotely troubleshoot the Dummy
						system two:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Request users to report all the issues they are experiencing. Make
							a note of all reported issues for further analysis.
						</li>
						<li>
							After receiving the issues, refer to the User Manual for potential
							solutions.
						</li>
						<li>
							Ask users to check the status of the system. If certain modules
							are not identified by the system, it may indicate potential
							issues.
						</li>
						<li>
							Check if there is a certain set of configuration loaded into the
							system. If not, guide users to reload the configuration in the
							necessary sequence. If the system is not retaining the
							configurations, on-site troubleshooting may be necessary.
						</li>
						<li>
							If the steps above don't resolve the issue, suggest users to
							perform a system reset.
						</li>
					</ol>

					<h2>Dummy Device Three Remote Troubleshooting Guide</h2>
					<p>
						This guide provides steps to remotely troubleshoot the Dummy Device
						system three:
					</p>
					<p>
						<em
							>Please note: Due to the nature of the Dummy Device system three,
							remote troubleshooting capabilities are limited. The main goal is
							to annotate issues to provide insight for future on-site
							troubleshooting.</em
						>
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Ask users to report all issues they are experiencing. Make a note
							of all reported issues for further investigation.
						</li>
						<li>
							You can perform a dummy test over the phone. Ask users to toggle a
							dummy setting, then listen for any response. The presence of a
							response indicates that the setting is functioning correctly. If
							there's no response, the setting is not operating as expected.
						</li>
						<li>
							As a last resort, instruct users to follow their procedures to
							perform a hard reset of the system.
						</li>
					</ol>

					<h2>Dummy System Four Remote Troubleshooting Guide</h2>
					<p>
						This guide provides steps to remotely troubleshoot the Dummy System
						Four:
					</p>
					<p>
						<em
							>Please note: The Dummy System Four can enter a degraded state due
							to certain atmospheric conditions.</em
						>
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Ask users to report all issues they are experiencing. Make a note
							of all reported issues for further investigation.
						</li>
						<li>
							After receiving the issues, refer to Table 1-2 in the Dummy
							Technical Order for potential corrective actions.
						</li>
						<li>
							Check with users if they have received any notifications that
							might affect the system.
						</li>
						<li>
							Instruct users to try their alternate system if they cannot log
							into their primary system.
						</li>
						<li>
							If the system fails to log into the alternate system, instruct
							users to perform a soft reset of the system.
						</li>
						<li>
							If the soft reset does not resolve the issue, instruct them to
							toggle a dummy switch, remove their dummy module and press the
							test button. If a light illuminates, the dummy module is
							functioning correctly. If the light does not illuminate, the dummy
							module may need to be replaced. Guide them through the process of
							replacing it if necessary.
						</li>
					</ol>

					<h2>Dummy System Five Remote Troubleshooting Guide</h2>
					<p>
						This guide provides steps to remotely troubleshoot the Dummy System
						Five:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Ask the users to report all problems they are experiencing and
							note down all reported issues. Additionally, instruct them to
							check the control display and inform you about the status of
							various indicators. Guide them through the process of running a
							test sequence if necessary.
						</li>
						<li>
							If a certain condition is met on the control display, instruct
							them to perform two specific commands. If that condition is not
							met, guide them through the process of performing a system reset
							and then executing the same commands.
						</li>
						<li>
							The first command will provide the status of the network
							connection, and the second command will reveal the status of the
							system.
						</li>
						<li>
							Ask them to inform you about the status of a particular module.
							Depending on the status, provide appropriate guidance.
						</li>
						<li>
							Guide them through the process of running a diagnostic check on a
							particular component. If there are any issues, proceed to the
							Local Check.
						</li>
						<li>
							If a certain condition is observed on the module, coordinate with
							the other users and guide them through the process of performing a
							system handshake.
						</li>
						<li>
							Depending on the status of the system and the result of the
							handshake, provide the next steps accordingly.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<br />
					<h3>Local Check</h3>
					<br />
					<ol>
						<li>
							Direct User A to perform a particular action on their system.
							Their system should show a certain state.
						</li>
						<li>
							Communicate with User B and ask them about the status of their
							system. Their system should reflect a certain state.
						</li>
						<li>
							If both systems are showing the correct indications, instruct User
							A to revert their system back to the normal mode and repeat steps
							1 and 2 for User B.
						</li>
						<li>
							If both systems display correct indications, guide both users
							through the process of resetting their systems and verifying their
							keys.
						</li>
						<li>
							Instruct both users to attempt a system handshake. Wait for the
							handshake to fail a certain number of times before declaring the
							system as an outage.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<br />
					<h3>Additional Notes</h3>
					<br />
					<ul>
						<li>
							Make sure that the control rack is active. Guide the users through
							the process of performing a lamp test if necessary.
						</li>
						<li>
							If a user can perform a certain action but cannot perform another
							action, guide them through the process of running a specific
							command and checking the status of a certain component.
						</li>
						<li>
							If a user can perform one action but cannot perform another
							action, guide them through the process of running a different
							command and adjusting the status of a certain network connection.
						</li>
						<li>
							If a certain network connection is down, instruct the users to
							adjust the status of an alternate connection and perform a test
							communication.
						</li>
						<li>
							If the previous steps or notes didn't resolve the issue, guide the
							users through the process of performing a system reset in a
							particular sequence.
						</li>
						<li>
							During the Local Check, if the other user's system doesn't display
							a specific indicator, it could either be a connection issue or a
							component issue.
						</li>
						<li>
							Some sites are connected to the central server via phone lines.
							All other sites are connected via dedicated network lines. If the
							issue is found to be a phone line problem, call the technical
							support center and ask to create a support ticket.
						</li>
					</ul>
