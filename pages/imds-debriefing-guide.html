							<h2>Navigating Your Journey for Recap</h2>
							<p>
								To navigate your journey for recap, use either the CTPY command
								if recapping on the same day, or the CTPY:Z:XLMN command if
								recapping at a later time.
							</p>
							<p>
								After using the CTPY command, you will be navigated to the
								screen showcased in the top image. Find your IMSD user ID and
								click on the date which serves as a hyperlink to your journey.
							</p>
							<p>
								As another option, you might want to use the 956 screen
								(presented in the bottom image). On this screen, you can fill in
								the Journey ID (consisting of the Year, Month, Day, and Journey
								Number). An alternate choice is to click the check mark and
								discover your journey from there.

							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>Journeys</strong>: This segment permits you to return
									to this screen by hovering over and clicking 'refresh'.
								</li>

									the journey for task completion. This is also the area where

									amend the status of your locations.
								</li>
								<li>

									region promptly shows the locations loaded on your journey.
									Green implies a location with no risk/hazard tags, while
									orange signifies a location that does.
